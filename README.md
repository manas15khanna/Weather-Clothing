## Project Overview
Your project uses data from OpenWeatherMap to make real-time recommendations for outfits based on current weather conditions. The Python backend runs a machine
learning model using Smola (a lightweight machine learning framework), integrating it with your web interface built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This setup allows
you to collect weather data in real time, preprocess it using the Python model, and generate clothing recommendations that are updated as the weather changes.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Weather Data**: You can access up-to-the-minute weather data from OpenWeatherMap via satellite imagery or satellites.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The Python backend uses Smola to train a machine learning model that predicts outfits based on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and
other factors.
- **Clothing Recommendations**: Based on the current weather conditions, the backend generates recommendations for clothing items such as tops, bottoms, and
footwear.
- **Web Interface**: Your project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web-based platform where users can view weather data and see their
outfit recommendations in real-time.

## Implementation
### Frontend
1. **Web Server**: The frontend uses php or another lightweight web framework to host your application.
2. **OpenWeatherMap API**: You will need to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API via OpenWeatherMap's REST interface using their service ID.
3. **Display Interface**: The frontend will display a header with weather information and a display area where your outfit recommendations appear.

### Backend/Python
1. **Smola Package**: Use Smola for implementing the machine learning model, enabling you to build a robust recommendation system that processes weather data into
clothing suggestions.
2. **Data Processing**: In Python, preprocess the OpenWeatherMap data (e.g., convert temperature and humidity into categories) and feed it into your model.
3. **Machine Learning Model**: Train the model on historical weather data combined with corresponding outfit recommendations to predict outfits for different weather
conditions.

## Installation
### Dependencies
1. php
   ```bash
   npm install php
   ```
2. OpenWeatherMap
   ```bash
   npm install openweathermap@latest
   ```
3. Python Framework and Model
   ```bash
   npm install python-dotnet 
   ```
4. Ollama and its model 
    ```bash
    pacman -S Ollama

    ollama run smollm

    ```

### Building the Project
#### Step 1: Set Up php Server
- Install dependencies.
- Run a simple server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  This will create a `index.html` in your project root directory.

#### Step 2: Configure OpenWeatherMap
- Activate the API key to use OpenWeatherMap data.

## Usage
1. **Access Weather Data**: Use OpenWeatherMap API to get current weather data.
2. **Generate Recommendations**: Upload the weather data into the HTML frontend and submit a request to your machine learning model.
3. **View Recommendations**: The backend will process the data and return outfit recommendations in JSON format. Your frontend displays these recommendations on a
webpage that also shows real-time weather information.

## Customization
- **Custom Clothing Items**: Modify the clothing recommendation system by adding different items or adjusting predictions based on specific weather criteria (e.g.,
light jackets for cold days).
- **Weather Categorization**: Enhance the project to categorize weather conditions into predefined categories and use this information to filter outfits.
- **Mobile Optimization**: If needed, optimize the frontend for mobile devices using Tailwind CSS or similar utility frameworks.

## Contributions
Contributors can modify any of the following components:
- OpenWeatherMap API: Modify or add new data sources.
-Server: Update the backend functionality and configuration.
- Machine Learning Model: Adjust the model architecture, loss function, optimizer, etc., to improve recommendations.
